# Homelab Learnings & Experiences

This directory contains notes, learnings, and experiences from working with my homelab.

## Structure

Files are named with date prefixes in the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-topic-name.md`

This makes it easy to:
- See when things happened chronologically
- Find recent learnings quickly
- Track learning journey over time
